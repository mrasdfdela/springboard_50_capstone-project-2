# Strava Capstone Project

2nd Capstone Project for Springboard

## Introduction

This project uses the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference). Strava is a social network for endurance athletes that I use to track mine and my friends' workout activities. In this project, I will work with Node/Express, React, and Strava's API & webhooks.
